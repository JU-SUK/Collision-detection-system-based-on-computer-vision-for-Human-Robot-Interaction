# Collision-detection-system-based-on-computer-vision-for-Human-Robot-Interaction

After the fourth industrial revolution, robots and operators have shared workspaces for more flexible and efficient production. As a result, collision between robots and the operators may occur, and a method to prevent such collision is needed. Therefore, this study proposes a system that detects collision between an operator and a robot and returns a signal by using a Depth camera that obtains RGB images and depth images. Through Human Pose Detector, the proposed collision detection system obtains the positional information, which key points of the operator, from the images taken by the Depth camera. In addition, the positional information of each robot link is obtained from the joint angle data of the robot through forward kinematics. Then a bounding volume, which is a criterion for detecting collisions, is applied to the operator and each link of robot using the OBB(Oriented Bounding Box) method. The SAT(Separated Axis Theorem) is used to return a feedback signal when bounding volumes are overlap. A collision simulation is conducted between an operator and a virtual robot to check the accuracy of the proposed system, which yields approximately 80%.
